## Overview

-   What was your experience?
    -   This was a really annoying project to build due to all the intricacies of the responsive design. Some problems came about when I tried to develop the search modal using Headless UI. I had to take some time to wrap my head around how modal styling actually works under the hood.
-   What have you learned/improved?
    -   I learned how to properly style modals and search input boxes. Headless UI provides a combobox component that allows for autocompletion as you type so I added it as a search bar instead that would link to the specific cat breed's page whenever the combobox option was clicked.
